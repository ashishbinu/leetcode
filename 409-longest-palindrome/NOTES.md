## Steps to solve
â€‹
* Create a set to store characters.
* Store characters if not already in set.
* Remove the character if it is again encountered in the string and increase the palindrome length by 2.
* Do the above steps till the end of the string.
* If the set still has characters we can use one more character to increase length of palindrome as middle element so the palindrome length increases by 2.
