### Algorithm
â€‹
* Put all the 0's to the front side of array and 2's to the end of the array.
* Left and right pointer to indicate the space where new 0 or 2 can be inserted respectively.
* i pointer lies between left and right pointer.
* It swaps the current value with left or right pointer if 0 or 2 respectively otherwise increment the i pointer.
* This then swaps the array.
